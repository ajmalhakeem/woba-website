            <h4>Members</h4>
            <p>WOBA is currently split into two categories. There is the open-to-public 
              <span class="strong"> Official Woba </span> and an invite-only 
              <span class="strong">Woba</span>.
              If you have any questions/comments about our two groups please <a href="#">contact</a> our administrators.</p>

          <div class="col-md-6">
            <h4>Servers</h4>
            <p>WOBA currently has a <a href="#">surf </a>server up and running that supports up to 32 players at a time. The dedicated server is being run in Australia so local players can experience low ping. As WOBA grows to be a larger and more active community, our main goal is to get more than 5 servers up by late 2015.

            <h4>Staff</h4>
            <p>The WOBA Staff are a handpicked group of people that are selected to organise and administrate the server. Being a staff member <em>does not</em> give you special permissions to the store or commands (Staff doesn't just get to spawn in 100k credits and buy whatever they want). To read more about our staff, please refer to the <a href="#">staff page</a>. If you would like to apply, please fill in <a href=#>form</a>.</p>

            <h4>Store</h4>
            <p>Our store system allows members to purchase (mostly cosmetic) goods to use in the server. Currently the store is limited to the surf server, but we are working hard to make stores available for our other servers. The store uses a virtual currency known as <span class="strong">credits</span>. You can earn credits for free by playing on the server, but you can also <a href="#">purchase them</a> from our website.</p>
