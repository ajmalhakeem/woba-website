              <h4>About Us</h4>
              <p>
                WOBA is a CS:GO clan formed by three active CS:GO players in 2014. <a href="#">Vectivis</a>,<a href="#"> Fusion</a>, and <a href="#">Mal</a> (that's me) had an idea to create a small group so that they could communicate with each other easier. We started off with a steam group that had only their closest friends in it, and we would take over random teamspeak servers and make that their own. At this period we had no vision of WOBA becoming a larger thing. We played competitive matches, only to notice our wins increase dramatically, because we were in a team of 5, instead of solo-Q'ing.
              </p>
              <p>
                With this, more and more people began to join the group, but we weren't active members. Fusion and I would play almost everyday, with Vectivis joining every other day. Now, we queued in lobbies together but it was just the 3 of us. We wanted 5. We realised how hard it is to get hold of active CS:GO players, and so decided to create a community that would recruit all active members. 
              </p>
              <p>
                At this time, we were very interested in surf. Surfing is a type of minigame that allows you to slide on ramps and surf while eliminating the enemy. Since playing competitive wasn't so fun anymore, they decided to build their own surf server.
              </p>
              <p>
                This is when the <em>WOBA Official</em> Steam group was created. Vectivis sorted out the hosting and plugins for the server, Fusion got the teamspeak server set up, and Mal, well, he made a pretty sick <a href="#">knife arena map.</a> This is the start of WOBA, and ever since, the WOBA community has risen above expectations and we have met countless numbers of active and friendly members of CS:GO that we wouldn't have if it wasn't for the server.
              </p>
              <p>
                With that being said, WOBA's developers are keen on keeping the server active and fun for everyone. We listen to feedback, because we've been the people that has given feedback in the past and didn't get any response. WOBA is unique because we don't just run a server and let the members be as they are, WOBA is constantly trying to evolve and be a better community (perhaps the best!). We ask for nothing in return other than to have members have fun on our servers. <a href="#">Donations</a> aren't necessary, but <em>any</em> donations given to us will be used to furthur improve the server.
